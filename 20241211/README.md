### Progress more than 1 week ago
1. I want to gain insight into cyber attacks against company network.
2. STARDUST is a base for observing cyber attacks. I want to use that.
3. I have to know what attackers do to our environment. 
So, I did some types of communication and captured event logs and contents of communication.
  - I used Sysmon to capture event logs and Wireshark to observe communications. 
5. Sysmon is useful, but some event logs are not captured. 
So, I have to look for a service that will not miss any event logs.
